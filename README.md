This is the link to my prject plan via trello
On the trello page includes links to my wireframes and Schema relationships and host my orginal intention with craeting the app.
It is enjoyable to see how much the finished app both varies and follows my plan hopefully highlighting that projects do not have to be super strict to the plan but that there is flexibilty for changes 
But that does not mean completely goign against the plan. Though there is flexibilty there should always be some structure you are folloeing to make it easier for yourself to create the app.
